# Introduction

After the web-scraping activity is completed, we will now perform exploratory data analysis on the used cars details.

## Data Sources

We have 2 CSV files in the **04_CarDetailsConsolidated** which we will ingest.

### Ingestion

First we load the required R libraries.

```{r}
#| label: Load Libraries
#| warning: false

library(readr)      # To cleanly ingest the CSV files
library(dplyr)      # To wrangle with the data
library(stringr)    # To efficiently work with character strings
library(janitor)    # To ensure consistent naming and other utilities

```

Since will be cleaning and combining 2 datasets, one from *cars24* and other from *carwale*, we will perform same action twice and handle some special cases in either datasets.

```{r}
cars24 <- read_csv("../04_CarDetailsConsolidated/cars24.csv", 
                   na = c("","NA","MISSING","Not Available"), show_col_types = FALSE)
carwale <- read_csv("../04_CarDetailsConsolidated/carwale.csv", 
                    na = c("","NA","MISSING","Not Available"), show_col_types = FALSE)

```

## "MISSING" values

In our data extraction scripts from the **03_CarDetails** folder, you would've noticed that while extracting the car attributes, we set the default value to **MISSING** if the value is not available. Thus we know for a fact that **MISSING** indicates a missing value and therefore can be explicitly set to NA while reading the CSV files.

After a quick manual verification of CSV files, we also understood that some attributes were *Not Available* can can be considered as `NA`.

The `read_csv` function from **readr** package allows us to explicitly mention which values to be considered as `NA` while reading the data.
