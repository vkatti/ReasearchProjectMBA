## Introduction 

This repository is the preparatory work for JAIN Online MBA - Final year research project. It contains all the code and intermediate files created to extract, transform and create the final used cars dataset that will be made available as part of the [UsedCarsIndia](https://github.com/vkatti/UsedCarsIndia "Link to Github Repository") R Package.

The used cars data was extracted from following webistes:

-   https://www.cars24.com
-   https://www.carwale.com

The extraction process required a multi-step approach due to the nested nature of the websites. The folders in this repository mirror this multi-step approach.

Following is a quick description of the folders in this repository.

## 01_Regions

First we extracted the URLs of the webpages corresponding to the Regions serviced by the used car companies.

This folder contains the Jupyter (iPython) Notebooks which extracts the base URLs of the Regions and stores them as a pickle (.pkl) file. This was achieved using Pandas, Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.

## 02_CarURLs

Once the URLs of the regions was available, then we extracted the URLs of the individual cars listed on the Search Results.

This folder contains the Jupyter (iPython) Notebooks which extracts the URLs of the Car Details pages and stores them as a pickle (.pkl) file. This was achieved using Pandas, Requests, Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup libraries.

As the search results were Paginated i.e. the cars were listed in groups of 20-24 with each set grouped under a single URL; we has to use Selenium WebDriver to crawl through the search results to extract the data from each page of the Search Results.

## 03_CarDetails

This folder contains the Jupyter (iPython) Notebooks which extracts the attributes of the used cars and stores them as a pickle (.pkl) file. This was achieved using Pandas, Requests, Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup libraries.

After some adhoc exploration of the HTML Source code of the Car Detail pages, we shortlisted the following columns for targeted extraction. These were specifically shortlisted based on the availability of the data for maximum number of cars and to limit the size of the data set. There were other attributes but were missing for majority of the entries.

-   make
-   model
-   variant
-   year
-   transmission
-   bodyType
-   fuelType
-   ownerNumber
-   odometerReading
-   cityRto
-   listingPrice
-   fitnessUpto
-   insuranceType
-   duplicateKey
-   city
-   registrationYear
-   registrationMonth
-   websiteUrl

The plan was to extract at least 10K used car details. This limit of 10K was imposed solely with the intent to keep the dataset size in check.

Once the Car URLs were available, we then extracted individual car details from their respective webpages. To ensure minimum loss of data, we saved the car details in groups of 100 in intermediate pickle files.

## 04_CarDetailsConsolidated

This folder contains the Jupyter (iPython) Notebooks which combines all pickle files containing car details and stores them as a Comma-delimited (CSV) file. This was achieved using Pandas and Glob libraries.

## 05_CleanAndCombine

This folder contains a Quarto (.qmd) document that uses R to load the CSV files, perform EDA, create the necessary tables and charts to be included in the Project Report and finally, save the cleaned dataset into .Rds format so that it can be made available in the [UsedCarsIndia](https://github.com/vkatti/UsedCarsIndia "Link to Github Repository") R Package.
